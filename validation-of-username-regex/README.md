Write a simple regex to validate a username. Allowed characters are:

lowercase letters,
numbers,
underscore
Length should be between 4 and 16 characters (both included).

I looked at regular expressions on MDN, and also referenced the notes on regex in the class repo and answers on stack overflow. I pasted my pseudo code into the kata, replaced english words with actual code, and refactored a bit.
