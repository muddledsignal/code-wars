I will give you two strings. I want you to transform stringOne into stringTwo one letter at a time.

Example:

stringOne = 'bubble gum';
stringTwo = 'turtle ham';

Result:
bubble gum
tubble gum
turble gum
turtle gum
turtle hum
turtle ham

First, we whiteboarded the problem domain, algorithm, visual, and pseudo code. Then we started writing the code, checking the mdn for details on methods we were using. We adjusted a few times before getting it to work just right.
